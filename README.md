# Project: Nubank Analytics Engineer Case


In order to solve all the proposed questions in the Nubank Analytics Engineer Case te files and folders bellow were created:

FILES:

- `case_answers.ipynb` :  This is the notebook with the answers for
the questions in the case;

- `etl.ipynb` :  This is the notebook with the instructions to do an ETL process
with the csv files using python and a Postgres database;

- `sql_querys.py` : Here are the querys to create, insert and drop the tables used in the `etl.ipynb` notebook;

- `brasil-states.json` : File used in a PIX metric;

- `proposed_diagram` : My proposed diagram after a remodeling. 

FOLDERS:

- `images` : The folder with the images used in the jupyter notebooks;

- `diagram` : The folder with the old diagram and the new diagram proposed by me, you can open this using dbdiagram.io;

- `tables\tables` : In this folder are the csv files with the data used in the case.


## Recomended steps:

1. Open the `etl.ipynb` where you will be guided to create a Postgres image with docker and in this notebook you can create the tables in the database to execute querys and test how it is working;

2. Open the `case_answers.ipynb` to see the approach used to answer the problems proposed.
